# MY GPG KEY


## ~~New Key~~

~~I have generated a new gpg key which uses ed25519 on April 14, 2016.~~

~~Fingerprint is: `8DFF D717 9861 AA02 EFC8  D667 0005 FF8C 062C D65F`.~~

~~And the key id is [0x0005ff8c062cd65f](http://sks.fidocon.de/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x0005FF8C062CD65F).~~

~~You can retrieve the key from servers running 1.1.5+ SKS in the [SKS Keyservers Pool](https://sks-keyservers.net/status/)
and you should use GPG 2.1 or above.~~

Update: 2016-04-21
